# Godot 3x3 Minimal Tile Template

A minimal, ready-to-use project template for creating 3x3 minimal auto-tiling or simple tilemaps in the Godot Engine.

This template is designed to quickly set up a TileSet resource and TileMap node based on the widely used 3x3 bitmasking rule, making it perfect for simple terrains like grass edges, paths, or water bodies that only require 8 surrounding neighbor checks.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

This template is directly inspired by and configured to utilize the concise tile mapping technique detailed in the Minimal 3x3 Tile Template tutorial by MichaGD.

Godot Engine Compatibility: Designed to work out-of-the-box with a compatible version of the Godot Engine (e.g., Godot 3.x or 4.x, depending on which engine version the template is built for).
